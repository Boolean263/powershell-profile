# Boolean263's PowerShell Profile

I'm starting to dive deeper into PowerShell, so I figured I should track my profile, modules, etc., etc. in git.

Ideally I'd add this to the repo holding my usual home-directory dotfiles and whatnot, but Windows wants this in a different place than pwsh on other OSes do. So it's its own repo.
